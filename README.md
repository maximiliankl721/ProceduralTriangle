Base triangle that can be iterated into more triangles. All new triangles are connected to the base triangle. 
Demonstration of transform feedback.

Explanation of the program:

When the program is started, a window is opened which renders a single triangle. The rendered object can be rotated using the arrow keys. The space bar resets it to the original view.
Buttons 1-5 can be used to switch through the iteration stages of the transform feedback, the buttons are analogous to the iteration steps that are performed when the button is pressed. 
It is irrelevant whether you switch through the buttons in sequence or first select a high iteration step and then a low one. The input of the keys and the rendered object are independent of each other. 
The 0 key can be used to switch back to the original triangle.
